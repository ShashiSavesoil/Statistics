        "- Statistics is a mathematical science including methods of collecting ,organizing and analysing data in such a way that meaningful conclusions can be drawn.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the two main types of statistics?\n",
        "- (1)Descriptive statistics- measures central tendency ,Dispersion,and  Symmetricity (2)Inferential statistics-\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What are descriptive statistics?\n",
        "- It consists of organizing and summarising the complete data population .\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is inferential statistics?\n",
        "- For example you cannot count no. of trees in a jungle\n",
        "It consists of using data that as been measured to form a conclusion about a population. With a given sample data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What is sampling in statistics?\n",
        "- In inferential statistics we take the decisions of whole population by analysizing the sample data, so it is very important how we select the sample , here we the types of smapling is called sampling.\n",
        "\n",

        "7.  5 What is the difference between random and non-random sampling\n",
        "- Random sampling - where all the samples have have equal chance of selecting .\n",
        "Advantage : minimizes bias,\n",
        "Disadvantages: Not feaible e for all poopulations\n",
        "NOn-random sapling - Selection of participatents based o. certain criteria. it is easy and inexpensive\n",
        "\n",
        "8.Define and give examples of qualitative and quantitative data?\n",
        "- Qualitative data means non numerical data which is the form of like strings, orders ,like blood group[A+Ve,B-Ve,..]\n",
        "Quntative data- examples are mobile phones/electronic devices in a computer centre. which is numerical\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What are the different types of data in statistics\n",
        "- Qualitative data ->> Discrite and contineous\n",

        "10. Explain nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio levels of measurementmm\n",
        "- Nominal->> data which is not measured or we cannot give ranking which is better than other , examples colours , blood group, post office code...\n",
        "- Ordinl->> data which we can have meaningful order, example salary range like high , medium and low but here we canbot measure the differencce.\n",

        "11.  What is the measure of central tendency\n",

        "\n",
        "12.  Define mean, median, and mode\n",
        "- Mean->> mean is the average the give data which is given by sum of observations by total no. of observations\n",

        "13. What is the significance of the measure of central tendency\n",
        "\n",

        "- Variance says how data is distributed and talks about spread of data at an overall level.\n",

        "- Calculte mean.\n",
        "- For each number in the data subract the mean and the number.\n",

        "- It essentially,  tells you on an average , how far each value in the data set.\n",
        "It helps to understand the varability or spread of data, helps to comparation of diffferent sets even if they have same mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Define and explain the term range in statistics?\n",
        "- Range is the simple measure of varability of data set which is given by max-min\n",
        "- A large range indicates the wider spread of data and smaller indicates the data is more tightly cluster\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between variance and standard deviation\n",
        "- Both measures the variability of data but their units are difernet\n",
        "- Standard Deviation is the square root of variance.\n",
        "varianve says how data is distributed and SD says how spread out numbers are and in same units .\n",

        "18. What is skewness in a dataset\n",
        "- Skewness the measure of symmetry\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What does it mean if a dataset is positively or negatively skewed\n",
        "- Positively distributed means most of the of the distribution of the data lies in the right side\n",
        "- Negatively distributed means most of the of the distribution of the data lies in the left side\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Define and explain kurtosis\n",
        "- Kurtosis, a statistical measure, describes the \"tailedness\" or extremity of a data distribution, indicating whether it has heavy or light tails compared to a normal distribution, and helps identify potential outliers\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the purpose of covariance\n",
